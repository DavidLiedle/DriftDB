#### üß™ Testing & Quality
- 159+ comprehensive tests (unit + integration)
- Performance benchmarks with Criterion
- Property-based testing with PropTest
- Async testing with Tokio
- Test coverage across all major features

### Added - SQL Features (from 0.7.0-alpha)

### Added
- Complete SQL parsing and execution layer (100% SQL syntax support for implemented features)
- Recursive Common Table Expressions (WITH RECURSIVE)
- Support for parenthesized arithmetic expressions
- Proper CTE table references in JOIN operations
- Complete expression evaluation in all contexts

### Fixed
- Fixed arithmetic evaluation in recursive CTEs (n + 1 was evaluating as n + 2)
- Fixed CTE table references in recursive JOIN operations
- Fixed parenthesized expressions returning null in simple SELECT
- Fixed column name preservation in CTE results
- Fixed compilation issue with missing test file
- Consolidated arithmetic evaluation to single consistent function

### Removed
- Removed all DriftQL references - now pure SQL
- Removed duplicate arithmetic evaluation functions

### Known Issues
- **CRITICAL**: No fsync after WAL writes - data loss risk on crash
- **CRITICAL**: WAL hardcoded to /tmp/wal path
- **CRITICAL**: 152+ compiler warnings indicating incomplete implementations
- Transaction isolation not properly implemented
- No authentication for admin tools
- Encryption key rotation is stubbed
- Incremental backups not implemented
- Many features partially implemented or mocked

### Status
- **Alpha Quality**: Not suitable for production use
- Core SQL execution works well
- Many database features incomplete or stubbed
- Requires significant work for production readiness

## [0.4.0] - 2024-01-20

### Added
- Full SQL aggregation support (SUM, COUNT, AVG, MIN, MAX)
- GROUP BY with HAVING clause filtering
- ORDER BY with multi-column sorting (ASC/DESC)
- LIMIT and OFFSET for pagination
- UPDATE with arithmetic expressions (e.g., `price * 0.9`)
- Support for multiple sequential JOINs
- Proper column name resolution in complex JOIN queries
- DELETE FROM syntax support

### Fixed
- Fixed UPDATE statement expression evaluation returning null
- Fixed GROUP BY not grouping correctly after JOINs
- Fixed compound identifier handling (table.column notation)
- Fixed multiple JOIN column projection showing wrong values
- Fixed DELETE statement parsing with FROM clause

### Improved
- Enhanced SQL to DriftQL query translation
- Better handling of table aliases in JOIN operations
- Improved column prefix management for conflicting names
