All notable changes to DriftDB will be documented in this file.

## [0.9.0-alpha] - 2025-10-10 - SQL Injection Prevention & Client Library Enhancements

### 🔒 Security Fixes
- **Fixed critical SQL injection vulnerability in client library**
  - Added `execute_escaped()` and `query_escaped()` methods with proper parameter escaping
  - Implemented SQL standard quote escaping (single quotes doubled)
  - Added comprehensive parameterized query example demonstrating SQL injection prevention
  - Successfully handles special characters: quotes, unicode, emoji, and SQL keywords in data

### ✨ New Features
- **Parameterized query support** (client library)
  - Added `execute_params()` and `query_params()` methods (ready for future server support)
  - Added `execute_escaped()` and `query_escaped()` methods (working now with client-side escaping)
  - Helper function `escape_params()` for safe SQL parameter substitution
  - Supports all Value types: Text, Int, Float, Bool, Null, Json, Bytes

### 📚 Examples & Documentation
- **New example**: `parameterized_queries.rs` - Comprehensive SQL injection prevention demo
  - Basic parameterized inserts
  - Special character handling (O'Reilly, quotes, semicolons)
  - Unicode and emoji support (世界, 🎉🚀✨)
  - Multiple parameter usage in WHERE clauses
- **Comprehensive edge case testing** via `edge_cases.rs` example
  - Error handling tests (5 scenarios)
  - Data type tests (7 scenarios including NULL, unicode, large integers)
  - Complex query tests (10 scenarios including aggregations, JOINs, ORDER BY)

### 🔧 Technical Changes
- Enhanced Row type conversion with `pg_row_to_row()` for extended query protocol
- Added proper type detection for bool, i64, f64, String, Vec<u8>, and Null
- Updated all examples to use explicit column names in INSERT statements
- Fixed transactional INSERT compatibility issues

### 📊 Test Results
- ✅ SQL injection prevented: Special characters properly escaped
- ✅ Unicode support: Chinese characters and emoji work perfectly
- ✅ Error handling: 4/5 tests passing (1 server limitation noted)
- ✅ Data types: 5/7 tests passing (2 server limitations noted)
- ⚠️ Complex queries: 3/10 fully working (server-side limitations with aggregations, JOINs)

### 🎯 Security Impact
- **Before**: Direct string interpolation allowed SQL injection attacks
- **After**: Proper escaping prevents SQL injection while maintaining functionality
- **Migration**: Backward compatible - new methods are additive

## [0.8.0-alpha] - 2025-10-05 - Column Ordering Fix

### 🐛 Bug Fixes
- **Fixed column ordering in SELECT queries** - Columns now returned in schema order
  - SELECT * queries were returning columns in alphabetical order instead of schema definition order
  - Root cause: HashMap iteration order in result conversion
  - Fix: Extract table schema columns while holding engine lock and pass to result converter
  - Prevents deadlock by getting columns before query execution completes

### 🔧 Technical Changes
- Modified `convert_sql_result()` to accept pre-extracted column ordering
- Added `extract_table_from_sql_static()` helper for SQL parsing
- Updated executor to get table columns before releasing write lock
- Removed debug logging from sql/executor.rs

## [0.7.3-alpha] - 2024-01-24 - Time-Travel Performance Fix

### 🚀 Performance Improvements
- **Integrated snapshots into time-travel queries** - Major performance optimization
  - Time-travel queries now use snapshots to avoid full event replay
  - Only replays events since the nearest snapshot
  - Reduces complexity from O(n) to O(k) where k << n
  - Expected 10-100x speedup for large tables with regular snapshots

### 🔧 Technical Changes
- Added `read_events_after_sequence()` method for efficient event filtering
- Modified `reconstruct_state_at()` to check for snapshots first
- Snapshot state conversion from String to serde_json::Value

### 📊 Impact
- **Before**: Every time-travel query loaded ALL events into memory
- **After**: Queries load snapshot + small delta of recent events
- **Example**: 1M events with 10K snapshots = 100x fewer events to process

## [0.7.2-alpha] - 2024-01-23 - Warning Cleanup

### 🧹 Code Quality Improvements
- **Massive warning reduction**: Fixed 318 compilation warnings (95% reduction from 335 to 17)
- **Unused variable fixes**: Prefixed hundreds of unused variables with underscores
- **Dead code annotations**: Added `#[allow(dead_code)]` to preserve architectural designs
- **Import cleanup**: Removed all unnecessary imports across the codebase
- **Pattern matching**: Fixed unused pattern variables throughout

### 📊 Statistics
- Starting warnings: 335
- Ending warnings: 17
- Files modified: 50+
- Lines changed: 1000+

### ✅ Build Status
- Project now builds cleanly in both debug and release modes
- Remaining 17 warnings are complex structural issues for future work
- All tests pass without compilation errors

## [0.7.1-alpha] - 2024-01-23 - Compilation Fixes

### 🔧 Bug Fixes
- **Fixed all compilation errors**: Resolved 158+ compilation errors across the codebase
- Fixed `audit.log_event()` method signatures to use `AuditEvent` struct
- Fixed DateTime `hour()` method calls by importing `chrono::Timelike` trait
