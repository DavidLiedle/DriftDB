driftdb --version

# Execute SQL directly
driftdb sql -d ./mydata -e "CREATE TABLE users (id INTEGER, email VARCHAR, status VARCHAR, PRIMARY KEY (id))"

# Or use interactive SQL file
driftdb sql -d ./mydata -f queries.sql
```

```sql
-- Create a temporal table
CREATE TABLE users (
    id INTEGER,
    email VARCHAR,
    status VARCHAR,
    created_at VARCHAR,
    PRIMARY KEY (id)
);

-- Insert data
INSERT INTO users VALUES (1, 'alice@example.com', 'active', CURRENT_TIMESTAMP);

-- Standard SQL queries with WHERE clauses
SELECT * FROM users WHERE status = 'active';
SELECT * FROM users WHERE id > 100 AND status != 'deleted';

-- UPDATE with conditions
UPDATE users SET status = 'inactive' WHERE last_login < '2024-01-01';

-- DELETE with conditions (soft delete preserves history)
DELETE FROM users WHERE status = 'inactive' AND created_at < '2023-01-01';

-- Time travel query (SQL:2011)
SELECT * FROM users
FOR SYSTEM_TIME AS OF '2024-01-15T10:00:00Z'
WHERE id = 1;

-- Query all historical versions
SELECT * FROM users
FOR SYSTEM_TIME ALL
WHERE id = 1;

-- Query range of time
SELECT * FROM users
FOR SYSTEM_TIME BETWEEN '2024-01-01' AND '2024-01-31'
WHERE status = 'active';

-- Advanced SQL Features (v0.6.0)
-- Column selection
SELECT name, email FROM users WHERE status = 'active';

-- Aggregation functions
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM users;
SELECT COUNT(email), AVG(age) FROM users WHERE status = 'active';
SELECT MIN(created_at), MAX(created_at) FROM users;

-- GROUP BY and aggregations
SELECT status, COUNT(*) FROM users GROUP BY status;
SELECT department, AVG(salary), MIN(salary), MAX(salary)
FROM employees GROUP BY department;

-- HAVING clause for group filtering
SELECT department, AVG(salary) FROM employees
GROUP BY department HAVING AVG(salary) > 50000;

-- ORDER BY and LIMIT
SELECT * FROM users ORDER BY created_at DESC LIMIT 10;
SELECT name, email FROM users WHERE status = 'active'
ORDER BY name ASC LIMIT 5;

-- Complex queries with all features
SELECT department, COUNT(*) as emp_count, AVG(salary) as avg_salary
FROM employees
WHERE hire_date >= '2023-01-01'
GROUP BY department
HAVING COUNT(*) >= 3
ORDER BY AVG(salary) DESC
LIMIT 5;
```

## SQL:2011 Temporal Syntax

### Standard Temporal Queries

```sql
-- AS OF: Query at a specific point in time
SELECT * FROM orders
FOR SYSTEM_TIME AS OF '2024-01-15T10:30:00Z'
WHERE customer_id = 123;

-- BETWEEN: All versions in a time range (inclusive)
SELECT * FROM accounts
FOR SYSTEM_TIME BETWEEN '2024-01-01' AND '2024-01-31'
WHERE balance > 10000;

-- FROM...TO: Range query (exclusive end)
SELECT * FROM inventory
FOR SYSTEM_TIME FROM '2024-01-01' TO '2024-02-01'
WHERE product_id = 'ABC-123';

-- ALL: Complete history
SELECT * FROM audit_log
FOR SYSTEM_TIME ALL
WHERE action = 'DELETE';
```

### Creating Temporal Tables

```sql
-- Create table with system versioning (standard SQL syntax)
CREATE TABLE orders (
    id VARCHAR PRIMARY KEY,
    status VARCHAR,
    customer_id VARCHAR,
    amount INTEGER
);

-- Insert data
INSERT INTO orders VALUES ('order1', 'pending', 'cust1', 100);

-- Update with conditions
UPDATE orders SET status = 'paid' WHERE id = 'order1';

-- Delete (soft delete preserves history for time-travel)
DELETE FROM orders WHERE id = 'order1';
```

### Transactions
```sql
-- Start a transaction
BEGIN TRANSACTION ISOLATION LEVEL REPEATABLE READ;

-- Multiple operations in transaction
INSERT INTO orders VALUES ('order2', 'pending', 'cust2', 200);
UPDATE orders SET status = 'shipped' WHERE id = 'order1';

-- Commit or rollback
COMMIT;
-- or
ROLLBACK;
```

### Time Travel Queries
```sql
-- Query historical state by timestamp
SELECT * FROM orders WHERE status = 'paid' AS OF '2025-01-01T00:00:00Z';

-- Query by sequence number
SELECT * FROM orders WHERE customer_id = 'cust1' AS OF @seq:1000;

-- Show complete history of a record (CLI command)
driftdb drift -d ./data --table orders --key "order1"
```

### Schema Migrations
```sql
-- Add a new column with default value
ALTER TABLE orders ADD COLUMN priority VARCHAR DEFAULT 'normal';

-- Add an index
CREATE INDEX idx_orders_created ON orders(created_at);

-- Drop a column
ALTER TABLE orders DROP COLUMN legacy_field;
```

### Maintenance
```bash
# Create snapshot for performance
driftdb snapshot -d ./data --table orders

# Compact storage
driftdb compact -d ./data --table orders

# Check database integrity
driftdb doctor -d ./data

# Show table statistics
driftdb analyze -d ./data --table orders
```

## Architecture

### Storage Layout

```
data/
  tables/<table>/
    schema.yaml           # Table schema definition
    segments/            # Append-only event logs with CRC32
      00000001.seg
      00000002.seg
    snapshots/           # Compressed materialized states
      00000100.snap
    indexes/             # Secondary B-tree indexes
      status.idx
      customer_id.idx
    meta.json           # Table metadata
  wal/                   # Write-ahead log for durability
    wal.log
    wal.log.1            # Rotated WAL files
  migrations/            # Schema migrations
    history.json
    pending/
  backups/               # Backup snapshots
```

### Event Types

- **INSERT**: Add new row with full document
- **PATCH**: Partial update by primary key
- **SOFT_DELETE**: Mark row as deleted (audit trail preserved)

### Segment Format

```
[u32 length][u32 crc32][varint seq][u64 unix_ms][u8 event_type][msgpack payload]
```

## Safety & Reliability

### Data Integrity
- **Write-Ahead Logging**: All writes go through WAL first for durability
- **CRC32 verification**: Every frame is checksummed
- **Atomic operations**: fsync on critical boundaries
- **Crash recovery**: Automatic WAL replay on startup

### Concurrency Control
- **ACID transactions**: Serializable isolation available
- **MVCC**: Multi-version concurrency control for readers
- **Deadlock detection**: Automatic detection and resolution
- **Connection pooling**: Fair scheduling with backpressure

### Security
- **Encryption at rest**: AES-256-GCM for stored data
- **Encryption in transit**: TLS 1.3 for network communication
- **Key rotation**: Automatic key rotation support
- **Rate limiting**: DoS protection with per-client limits

## 🎯 Use Cases

### Compliance & Audit
```sql
-- "Prove we had user consent when we sent that email"
SELECT consent_status, consent_timestamp
FROM users
FOR SYSTEM_TIME AS OF '2024-01-15T14:30:00Z'
WHERE email = 'user@example.com';
```

### Debugging Production Issues
```sql
-- "What was the state when the error occurred?"
SELECT * FROM shopping_carts
FOR SYSTEM_TIME AS OF '2024-01-15T09:45:00Z'
WHERE session_id = 'xyz-789';
```

### Analytics & Reporting
```sql
-- "Show me how this metric changed over time"
SELECT DATE(SYSTEM_TIME_START) as date, COUNT(*) as daily_users
FROM users
FOR SYSTEM_TIME ALL
WHERE status = 'active'
GROUP BY DATE(SYSTEM_TIME_START);
```

### Data Recovery
```sql
-- "Restore accidentally deleted data"
INSERT INTO users
SELECT * FROM users
FOR SYSTEM_TIME AS OF '2024-01-15T08:00:00Z'
WHERE id NOT IN (SELECT id FROM users);
```
