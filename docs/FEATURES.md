## ‚ö†Ô∏è Partially Implemented (Framework exists but not functional)

These features have code structure but lack the integration or implementation to actually work:

- **Query optimization rules** - Defined but mostly return input unchanged
- **Distributed query execution** - Coordinator exists but not wired to engine
- **Materialized views** - Can be defined but don't refresh

## üéØ What Actually Works Today

If you want to use DriftDB right now, you can reliably use:

1. **Core SQL Operations**
   - CREATE TABLE with standard SQL syntax
   - INSERT with VALUES clause
   - SELECT with WHERE conditions
   - JOINs: INNER JOIN, LEFT JOIN, CROSS JOIN
   - Time-travel queries with AS OF
   - Soft deletes preserving history

2. **Storage Features**
   - Append-only storage with CRC32 verification
   - Snapshot creation with compression
   - B-tree secondary indexes
   - Basic backup and restore

3. **Basic Distribution**
   - Raft consensus for leader election
   - Basic replication framework

## üìä Implementation Statistics

- **~30% Fully Working**: Core storage, basic SQL, time-travel
- **~40% Partially Implemented**: Framework exists but needs integration
- **~30% Not Implemented**: Planned or mentioned only

## üöß Production Readiness

**Current Status: Development/Prototype**

DriftDB is suitable for:
- Learning and experimentation
- Proof of concept projects
- Development environments

NOT ready for:
- Production workloads
- Mission-critical data
- High-performance requirements

### Why Not Production Ready?

1. **Incomplete Integration**: Many features exist in isolation but aren't connected
2. **Limited Testing**: Advanced features lack comprehensive tests
3. **Naive Implementations**: Many algorithms use simple rather than optimized approaches
4. **Missing Error Recovery**: Error handling paths often incomplete
5. **No Performance Tuning**: No benchmarking or optimization done
6. **Lack of Documentation**: Most features undocumented beyond code comments

## üõ†Ô∏è Development Priorities

To make DriftDB production-ready, focus on:

1. **Integration First**: Connect existing components (e.g., wire triggers to engine)
2. **Testing**: Comprehensive test coverage for all features
3. **Error Handling**: Proper error recovery and resilience
4. **Performance**: Benchmark and optimize critical paths
5. **Documentation**: User guides and API documentation
6. **Tooling**: Management CLI, monitoring, migration tools

## üí° Conclusion

DriftDB has ambitious architecture with many enterprise features sketched out, but currently delivers a functional time-series database with basic SQL support. The codebase is more of a "database construction kit" than a finished database product.
