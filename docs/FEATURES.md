## Legend

- ✅ Implemented and functional
- ⚠️ Partially implemented (structure exists but not fully integrated)
- ❌ Not implemented (planned/mentioned only)

## Production Readiness

**Current Status:** Development/Prototype

While DriftDB has many advanced features defined, the current implementation is best suited for:
- Development and testing environments
- Proof of concept projects
- Learning and experimentation

For production use, significant additional work is needed on:
- Testing and validation
- Error handling and recovery
- Performance optimization
- Monitoring and management tools
- Documentation and examples

See [FEATURES_HONEST.md](./FEATURES_HONEST.md) for a detailed assessment of each feature's implementation status.
