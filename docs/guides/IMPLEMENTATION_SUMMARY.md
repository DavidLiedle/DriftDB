- RAII pattern with EngineGuard
- Connection reuse and lifecycle management
- Wait time metrics

âœ… **Authentication System**
- MD5 authentication
- SCRAM-SHA-256 support
- User management (CREATE USER, ALTER USER, DROP USER)
- Account lockout after failed attempts
- Password policies

âœ… **Rate Limiting**
- Token bucket algorithm
- Per-connection and per-query limits
- Adaptive rate limiting based on load
- Query cost estimation
- Configurable burst capacity

âœ… **WAL & Recovery**
- Write-ahead logging for durability
- Crash recovery testing (9 scenarios)
- Atomic segment writes
- Corruption detection and recovery

âœ… **Backup & Restore**
- SQL commands (BACKUP TO, RESTORE FROM)
- Consistent snapshots
- Compression support
- Progress tracking

## Technical Architecture

### Key Design Decisions
1. **PostgreSQL Wire Protocol**: Full compatibility for seamless client integration
2. **Event Sourcing**: All changes as immutable events with time-travel
3. **Nested Loop Joins**: Simple, correct implementation over hash joins
4. **Box::pin for Recursion**: Handles recursive async queries (subqueries, set ops)
5. **Token Bucket Rate Limiting**: Fair resource allocation with burst capacity

### Performance Optimizations
- Subquery result caching
- Connection pooling
- Lazy evaluation for large result sets
- Efficient duplicate detection with HashSet
- Query cost estimation for rate limiting

## Testing Coverage

### SQL Feature Tests
- `test_subqueries.sql`: Comprehensive subquery scenarios
- `test_distinct.py`: DISTINCT clause validation
- `test_set_operations.py`: UNION/INTERSECT/EXCEPT tests
- `test_explain_plan.py`: Query plan generation

### Infrastructure Tests
- `test_wal_recovery.py`: WAL crash recovery scenarios
- `test_backup_restore.py`: Backup/restore validation
- `test_engine_wal_integration.py`: Engine-WAL integration

## Remaining TODO Items

1. **Index Optimization in WHERE Clauses**
   - Use existing B-tree indexes for faster filtering
   - Index selection based on query predicates
   - Multi-column index support

2. **Prepared Statements**
   - Parse once, execute many times
   - Parameter binding
   - Execution plan caching

3. **Comprehensive SQL Test Suite**
   - TPC-H benchmark queries
   - Edge case testing
   - Performance regression tests

## Build & Run

```bash
# Build release binary
cargo build --release

# Start server
./target/release/driftdb-server --data-path ./data

# Connect with psql
psql -h 127.0.0.1 -p 5433 -d driftdb -U driftdb

# Run tests
python3 test_distinct.py
python3 test_set_operations.py
python3 test_explain_plan.py
```

## Metrics & Health

- Health check: http://localhost:8080/health/live
- Readiness: http://localhost:8080/health/ready
- Metrics: http://localhost:8080/metrics (Prometheus format)

## Version History

- v0.5.0: Time travel, replication, WAL fixes
- v0.6.0: Production infrastructure (auth, pooling, rate limiting)
- v0.7.0: SQL completeness (JOINs, subqueries, set operations)
- v0.8.0: DISTINCT, EXPLAIN PLAN

## Summary

DriftDB has evolved from a basic time-travel database to a significantly improved alpha system with enhanced SQL support. The implementation prioritizes correctness and PostgreSQL compatibility for development/testing use. The event-sourced architecture provides unique time-travel capabilities while maintaining ACID properties for basic operations.
