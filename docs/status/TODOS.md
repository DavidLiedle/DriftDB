# DriftDB TODO List

## Project Status: ~85% Complete

DriftDB is a production-ready append-only database that is mostly complete but has some critical issues that need addressing before it can be considered fully production-ready.

## ðŸ”´ Critical Issues (Blocking)

### 1. Fix Replication Integration Tests
**Priority: HIGH**
**Status: Tests don't compile**
**Impact: Blocks CI/CD and release**

The replication integration tests are failing with compilation errors:
- `ReplicationConfig` struct has changed (no longer has `enabled` field)
- `ReplicationCoordinator::new()` signature changed (takes 1 arg instead of 3)
- Missing `connect_to_master()` method

**Action Required:**
- Update test files to match the new ReplicationCoordinator API
- Fix struct initialization to match current implementation
- Either implement missing methods or update tests to use correct methods

## ðŸŸ¡ Important Issues (Should Fix)

### 2. Verify Production Features
**Priority: MEDIUM-HIGH**
**Status: Untested**

The README claims many production features that need verification:
- **WAL (Write-Ahead Log)**: Code exists but needs integration testing for crash recovery
- **Backup & Restore**: BackupManager implemented but needs end-to-end testing
- **Encryption at Rest**: KeyManager exists but not integrated with storage layer
- **Connection Pooling**: ConnectionPool implemented but not used by Engine
- **Rate Limiting**: RateLimiter exists but not integrated with query execution
- **Health Checks**: Not implemented despite README claims
- **Distributed Tracing**: OpenTelemetry setup incomplete

### 3. Complete Admin Tool
**Priority: MEDIUM**
**Status: Partially implemented**

The `driftdb-admin` binary has many unused variables and incomplete commands:
- Dashboard command not implemented
- Monitoring features incomplete
- Migration commands need testing
- Backup/restore CLI integration missing

## ðŸŸ¢ Minor Issues (Nice to Have)

### 4. Documentation Accuracy
**Priority: LOW-MEDIUM**
**Status: Misleading in places**

- README claims "100% production ready" but several features are incomplete
- Installation instructions reference non-existent GitHub org (`github.com/driftdb/driftdb`)
- API documentation missing
- Architecture documentation would be helpful

### 5. Code Quality Improvements
**Priority: LOW**
**Status: Good enough**

- 2 remaining async clippy warnings (MutexGuard across await) - intentionally left due to hybrid architecture
- Some test files have unused imports
- Could benefit from more integration tests
- Performance benchmarks exist but could be expanded

## âœ… Completed Work

### Recently Fixed:
1. **Migration System** - Refactored to work through Engine API with transactions
2. **File Locking** - Added exclusive locks to prevent concurrent access
3. **Compiler Warnings** - All cleaned up
4. **Clippy Warnings** - Addressed or suppressed with justification
5. **Primary Key Serialization** - Fixed critical bug in patch events

### Working Features:
- Core storage engine with append-only events
- Time-travel queries with `AS OF` syntax
- ACID transactions with multiple isolation levels
- B-tree secondary indexes
- Snapshots and compaction
- Schema migrations with version control
- Query optimizer with cost-based planning
- CLI with DriftQL support
- Demo scenario runs successfully

## ðŸ“‹ Recommended Action Plan

1. **Immediate** (1-2 days):
   - Fix replication integration tests to unblock CI
   - Run full test suite and fix any failures
   - Update README to accurately reflect current state

2. **Short Term** (3-5 days):
   - Integration test each production feature claimed in README
   - Either implement missing features or remove claims
   - Complete health check endpoints
   - Wire up connection pooling and rate limiting

3. **Medium Term** (1-2 weeks):
   - Complete admin tool functionality
   - Add comprehensive integration test suite
   - Performance testing and optimization
   - Security audit of encryption implementation

4. **Long Term** (ongoing):
   - Add distributed deployment capabilities
   - Implement missing replication features (consensus, automatic failover)
   - Build proper documentation site
   - Create example applications

## ðŸŽ¯ Definition of "Complete"

The project can be considered complete when:
1. All tests pass (including replication)
2. All features claimed in README are actually working
3. Admin tool provides basic operational capabilities
4. Documentation accurately reflects the implementation
5. At least one production deployment has been successfully tested

## ðŸ’­ Architectural Observations

The codebase shows signs of rapid development toward a "100% production ready" goal:
- Many features are implemented but not integrated
- The hybrid sync/async architecture works but creates some awkwardness
- The core is solid but the periphery needs work
- Code quality is generally good with proper error handling

The project would benefit from a focus on integration over new features - making sure everything that exists actually works together as a cohesive system.

## ðŸš€ Overall Assessment

DriftDB is an ambitious project that has successfully implemented the hard parts (append-only storage, time travel, transactions) but needs work on the integration and operational aspects. With 1-2 weeks of focused effort, it could genuinely be production-ready for small to medium deployments.

The biggest risk is the disconnect between marketed features and actual implementation. It would be better to under-promise and over-deliver by being transparent about what's actually working versus what's planned.
