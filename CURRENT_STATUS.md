# DriftDB Current Status Report

## ‚úÖ Working Features

### Core Database Engine
- **Table creation**: Works with DriftQL syntax `CREATE TABLE users (pk=id, INDEX(name, email))`
- **Data insertion**: Works with JSON documents `INSERT INTO users {"id": "u1", "name": "Alice"}`
- **Data querying**: Basic SELECT works `SELECT * FROM users`
- **Data updates**: PATCH works with `PATCH users KEY "u1" SET {"age": 31}`
- **Time-travel queries**: AS OF queries work! `SELECT * FROM users AS OF @seq:2`
- **Event sourcing**: All changes are stored as immutable events with sequence numbers
- **CRC32 verification**: Data integrity checks on all frames
- **Persistence**: Data is properly saved to disk and survives restarts

### CLI Interface
- Uses DriftQL syntax (not SQL:2011 yet)
- Supports basic CRUD operations
- Time-travel queries with AS OF
- No semicolons required at end of statements

### PostgreSQL Wire Protocol Server
- Successfully starts and listens on port 5433
- Accepts TCP connections
- Implements protocol message encoding/decoding
- Has authentication framework (cleartext/MD5)
- Session management with connection pooling

## ‚ùå Broken/Incomplete Features

### SQL:2011 Support
- **Parser exists but not integrated**: The SQL:2011 parser module was created but never properly exported
- **CLI still uses DriftQL**: The CLI uses the old DriftQL parser, not SQL:2011
- **Missing exports**: `sql::Parser` and `sql::Executor` types don't exist as claimed
- **Incomplete implementation**: TemporalQueryResult is a struct, not enum with Success/Records/Error variants

### PostgreSQL Server Issues
- **Query executor incomplete**: The bridge between PostgreSQL protocol and DriftDB engine is partially implemented
- **SQL parsing mismatch**: Server expects SQL but engine only understands DriftQL
- **Limited query support**: Only basic SELECT, INSERT, CREATE TABLE partially work
- **No real SQL support**: Can't handle actual PostgreSQL SQL queries

### Other Issues
- **SHOW DRIFT command hangs**: The drift history command appears to hang indefinitely
- **No transactions**: Transaction support is stubbed but not implemented
- **No indexes in practice**: Index creation syntax exists but indexes aren't actually used
- **No WAL**: Write-ahead logging was attempted but not properly implemented
- **No replication**: Replication module exists but isn't functional

## üéØ Critical Path to Working Product

### Priority 1: Fix SQL Support
1. Either fully implement SQL:2011 OR remove claims about it
2. Make CLI and server use the same query language
3. Properly export SQL module types if keeping SQL:2011

### Priority 2: Complete PostgreSQL Server
1. Fix query executor to properly bridge protocols
2. Add proper SQL-to-DriftQL translation layer
3. Test with actual psql client

### Priority 3: Fix Core Issues
1. Debug and fix SHOW DRIFT hanging
2. Implement proper transaction support
3. Make indexes actually work for queries

## üìä Assessment

**Current State**: Alpha quality with working core features but broken integration layers

**What Works Well**:
- Core time-travel functionality is solid
- Event sourcing and persistence work correctly
- Basic CRUD operations function properly

**Main Problem**:
The project has two query languages (DriftQL and SQL:2011) that aren't properly integrated. The PostgreSQL server can't execute queries because it expects SQL but the engine only understands DriftQL.

**Recommendation**:
1. Pick ONE query language and stick with it
2. If keeping SQL:2011, complete the implementation
3. If keeping DriftQL, remove SQL:2011 code and update docs
4. Focus on making PostgreSQL server work with chosen language

## Test Commands That Work

```bash
# Initialize database
./target/release/driftdb init test_data

# Create table (no semicolon!)
./target/release/driftdb sql --data test_data -e 'CREATE TABLE users (pk=id, INDEX(name, email))'

# Insert data
./target/release/driftdb sql --data test_data -e 'INSERT INTO users {"id": "u1", "name": "Alice", "age": 30}'

# Query data
./target/release/driftdb sql --data test_data -e 'SELECT * FROM users'

# Update data
./target/release/driftdb sql --data test_data -e 'PATCH users KEY "u1" SET {"age": 31}'

# Time travel query
./target/release/driftdb sql --data test_data -e 'SELECT * FROM users AS OF @seq:2'

# Start PostgreSQL server
./target/release/driftdb-server --data-path test_data
```
